# Tabby Web Authentication Handler

This is a plugin for the [Tabby Terminal](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby), a terminal emulator and SSH client. The plugin provides a web authentication handler for Tabby.

## Features

When a web authentication is requested by the server, this plugin opens a native browser window to handle the authentication process. This provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to authenticate with web services directly from the terminal.

## Installation

Plugins and themes can be installed directly from the Settings view inside Tabby.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin will automatically handle web authentication requests from the server.

## Configuration

An open browser button is provided in the config to allow users to open a browser window manually. Useful to setup SSO login sessions.
